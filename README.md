## 🎵 Spotify Clone (Frontend Only)

Welcome to my Spotify Clone!This is a frontend-only project built with HTML and CSS to replicate the design and layout of the official Spotify web player.

# 🚀 What’s Inside?

🎧 A visually rich UI closely mimicking Spotify's design

📁 Organized folder structure for easy navigation

💻 Responsive layout (mobile responsiveness in progress)

*This project is purely static — no functionality yet, but the design is ready and crafted with love!

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5

- CSS

# 🔮 What's Next?

I plan to:

- Integrate JavaScript for interactivity

- Add audio playback features

- Implement playlist functionality

- Possibly connect to Spotify's API in the future for real data

Stay tuned for updates! 🌟
